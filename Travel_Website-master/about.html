        <h2>What we do as a global travel agency?</h2> <br>
        <mark>Travel With Me and other Travel Agencies</mark>
        are providers of travel management services on a global scale. <br>
        These agencies differ in terms of their size and scale, as well as the services that are on offer. <br>
        <br>
        These agencies are used by companies and organizations that engage in international travel and need
        professional help. <br>
        <br>
        <h2>What does a global travel agency do?</h2> <br>
        Global travel agencies help businesses and individuals to coordinate their travel activities. <br>
        <br>
        Some core services offered by a global travel agency might include: <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Full-service global travel arrangements</li>
            <li>Flights</li>
            <li>Hotels</li>
            <li>Additional travel services</li>
            <li>Car hire</li>
            <li>Resorts & Spa</li>
            <li>And many more</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h2>What is the difference between
            <mark><em>Travel With Me</em></mark>
            and any other travel agent?
        </h2>
        <br>
        A global travel agency is typically composed of a large team of corporate travel agents. <br>
        These agents work together toward a common goal and as part of the same enterprise. <br>
        <br>
        Some corporate travel agents, however, might work on an individual basis as consultants or with <br>
        their own businesses. <br>
